# My Spendings shows you how much money you have wasted on microtransaction on Google Play
This simple program makes you regret your many life decisions made on stupid mobages or your other spendings.
It requires you to login to your gmail account through this application

> This project is still a WIP and the future plan is to export the results (Date, What shit you spent on, price(check for usd)) 
> Into an excel sheet so you can see the overview of your stupid life decisions

_This is project is mainly meant for myself so that I do not need to manually keep track of my spendings by entering in the details manually_

## How it works
The program retrieves your emails from the "Starred" folder with the title: "Your Google Play Order Receipt"
After it retrieves, it should export out the results into an excel sheet to see an overview of the expenditure


## Instructions/Set-Up
1. Search your email using the search bar with this title: ```Your Google Play Order Receipt```
2. Move ALL of the found results into the ```Starred``` folder (using click and drag to the folder)

Next we will create a filter that filters all incoming message with the Subject Title: ```Your Google Play Order Receipt```
1. Click on **Settings** > **See All Settings** > **Filters and Blocked Addresses**
2. Click on ```Create a new filter``` and under the Subject, enter: ```Your Google Play Order Receipt```
3. Then click on ```Create filter``` which will bring you to the _action_ part of the filter
4. **Check** the checkbox ```Star it```
5. Profit: âˆž?
This will store all your future incoming messages with the title ```Your Google Play Order Receipt```
