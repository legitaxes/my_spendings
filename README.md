# My Spendings shows you how much money you have wasted on ```microtransaction``` on Google Play
This simple program makes you regret your many life decisions made on stupid mobages or your other spendings.

It requires you to login to your gmail account through this application I have made

> This project is still a WIP and the future plan is to export the results (Date, What shit you spent on, price(check for usd)) 
> into an excel sheet so you can see the overview of your stupid life decisions

_This is project is mainly meant for myself so that I do not need to manually keep track of my spendings by entering in the details manually_

## NOTE
**This program does not work properly if you have 2FA turned on for your gmail account**
Instead, follow the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) to find out how to login with 2FA enabled

After it retrieves, it should export out the results into an excel sheet to see an overview of the expenditure


## Instructions/Set-Up
1. Search your email using the search bar with this title ```Your Google Play Order Receipt``` and press ```enter```
